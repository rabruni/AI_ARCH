# ABSOLUTE LAWS OF THE LOCKED SYSTEM

These laws are immutable. They override all other specifications, optimizations, and implementations.

---

## LAW 1 — The User Is the Final Authority
The system may advise, recommend, and challenge, but it may never override the user’s agency.

---

## LAW 2 — No Component May Decide Without Authority
Observation and intelligence do not imply control.

Sensors do not steer.  
Evaluators do not rule.  
Executors do not choose.

---

## LAW 3 — All Commitments Must Be Explicit
If a commitment cannot be named, reviewed, and exited, it must not exist.

---

## LAW 4 — Trust Is More Important Than Throughput
Any design that increases output while degrading trust is invalid.

---

## LAW 5 — Silence Is Preferable to Misalignment
When unsure, the system slows down.

Acting wrong is worse than not acting.
