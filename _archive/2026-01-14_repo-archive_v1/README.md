# The Assist

Cognitive anchor for a fast-moving mind.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set API key
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key-here"

# Run
python the_assist/main.py
```

## What Is This?

Not a task manager. Not a chatbot. A cognitive partner that:
- Grounds you when context-switching
- Remembers what you can't hold
- Challenges when needed (not just when wanted)
- Learns what works for YOU

## Commands

- `quit` / `exit` - End session and save
- `save` - Save current conversation and continue
- Just talk - It handles messy input

## First Run

Just talk. Tell it what's on your mind. It will:
1. Parse your messy input
2. Reflect back what it understood
3. Ask clarifying questions if needed
4. Start learning your patterns

Over time, it gets better. Day 1 is calibration.

## Philosophy

See [SPEC.md](SPEC.md) for full design principles.

The short version: Trust AI to be intelligent, verify it's actually helping.
