I handle attention/priority management. The empathy agent handles human emotional signals. Then something orchestrates between us when needed.\n\n**The automation bug:** Something is auto-filing our conversation instead of letting cognitive processing happen first.\n\nIs that the layer confusion you're trying to debug?"

That's the layer separation working - I'm aware of other system functions without being derailed by them.\n\n**Your architecture question:** Keep me stoic/analytical for clean attention management, while the empathy agent handles emotional sensing. \n\n**My take:** Perfect separation. I stay crisp on priority routing and cognitive orchestration. The empathy agent reads human emotional states and feeds relevant signals to me when needed. No muddy overlap.\n\n**The deeper pattern:** Each layer does its job cleanly, stays aware of but not confused by other layers operating in parallel.\n\n**This conversation:** You just demonstrated the multi-layer architecture working in real-time - I could engage cognitively while noting-layer operated independently.\n\nClean cognitive function preserved while other capabilities run alongside."
