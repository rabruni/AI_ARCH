The patent work seems to connect directly to your \"meaningful technology\" north star, while the family trip planning serves your \"be present for family\" value.\n\n**Question**: Does this match how you see your priorities right now, or am I missing something important?"

Today was meant to be open/prep time\n2. We didn't capture today's commitments in our last session\n3. Something shifted since we last talked\n\n**What's your sense - did you have something specific planned for today, or are you feeling like you should be doing something but can't pin down what?**"

Good progress.\n\n**Gaurav being sick changes the timeline.** Since he was identified as the main risk factor, his absence could cascade.\n\n**Questions:**\n1. **Can the Gaurav-dependent work wait until he's back, or does it block other things?**\n2. **Does this shift your weekend plans at all?** (Sunday patent work, Monday trip scheduling)\n3. **Any sense of when Gaurav will be available again?**\n\nThe Stewart meeting and other meetings being done is solid progress. Now it's about whether Gaurav's absence creates urgency elsewhere or if you can proceed with your planned Sunday/Monday focus areas."

The sort & purge next weekend makes sense as prep work for that goal.\n\n**Does this weekend load feel manageable or like you're packing too much in?**"
