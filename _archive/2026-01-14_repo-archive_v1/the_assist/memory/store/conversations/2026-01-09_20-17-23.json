Key threads:\n\n**Immediate (next 2 days):**\n- Patent work: 2hrs Sunday OR complete plan with timeline/costs\n- Bella's cheer competition Saturday - you're attending\n- Gaurav coordination risk (bottleneck mentioned 3x) - needs mitigation ASAP\n\n**Monday collision brewing:**\n- Eye appointment (PM) + parents/grandma visit (evening) + family trip departure\n- You built buffer time, but worth confirming logistics\n\n**Weekly rhythm progress:**\n- You want proactive nudges, not just reactive task management\n- Sunday planning routine starting - patent work fits here\n- Storage declutter scheduled for next weekend\n\n**Still queued:**\n- \"Forgot what\" topic for next session\n- Stewart dataset handoff (pending)\n- Sunday priority allocation (potential conflict)\n\n**The Donna model question:** You want me anticipating when to push vs give space, being your cognitive anchor beyond task management.\n\nWhat's most pressing right now? The Gaurav bottleneck risk seems like it could cascade if not handled soon."

The trip planning can flex around the fixed appointments.\n\n**Updated question:** When do you want to tackle the trip planning? \n\nOptions:\n1. Sunday during your planning session (along with patent work)\n2. Monday morning before eye appointment\n3. Earlier this weekend while parents visit is fresh in mind for coordination\n\nAlso still flagging: **Gaurav bottleneck risk** - you've mentioned this multiple times. What's the specific risk and timeline? That seems like it could impact your whole week if it hits.\n\nWhat needs attention first?"

You said you had something queued to discuss but couldn't remember what it was, wanted to bring it up next time. Ring any bells now?\n\n**Austin travel (Jan 20th):** That's 11 days out. Personal or work? Do you have preferred timing/hotels, or is this something to batch with Monday's travel planning?\n\n**Gaurav situation:** Good you have backup SAs ready. Are you waiting to see if he responds, or do you want to proactively reach out to alternatives? Timeline on this project?\n\nThe bottleneck risk seems contained now with your backup plan. What's next priority - Austin booking or something else?"

Or should we let it surface naturally and focus on more pressing items like Austin travel booking?"

Is this a tech product (aligns with your north star) or something else? Understanding this helps me prioritize properly.\n\n**Timeline pressure check:**\n- Austin travel: Jan 20 (11 days)\n- Financial strategy: End Feb (7 weeks)\n- Patent work: This weekend\n- Farmed up stewspeed: ASAP\n\nThe \"ASAP\" vs \"end of Feb\" suggests different urgency levels. Is stewspeed something that could unlock other priorities, or is it independent?\n\nAlso noting: This might be your \"forgot what\" item - either the financial strategy or the stewspeed project. Both feel like bigger initiatives that could easily slip through cracks.\n\nWhat's the most critical path right now?"

  "summary": "We updated your priorities: Stewart handoff completed, travel planning moved to Monday evening, Gaurav has backup SAs ready, added Austin travel booking (Jan 20th), financial/investment strategy adjustment (execute by end Feb), and Farmed up stewspeed project launch (ASAP priority) - with the mystery \"forgot what\" item likely being one of these two new strategic initiatives."
