I should have caught that and removed it from active risks.\n\nLet me clean that up. What I'm seeing as the real current blockers:\n\n**Sunday's time allocation conflict** - You've got patent work commitment vs family prep vs weekly planning routine all hitting the same day\n\n**That nagging \"forgot something\" feeling** - Still unresolved from our last session\n\n**Austin travel booking** - 11 days out for Jan 20, getting into crunch territory\n\nThe Gaurav bottleneck pattern is noted for future, but you're right - that specific instance got handled. My pattern tracking got ahead of current reality.\n\nWhat's actually feeling most pressing right now?"
