Also one thing to note in memory, be mindful of over explaining often genAi is not self aware - so things like \"My pattern tracking got ahead of current reality.\" a comment you made can erode trust as that is not what really happened. what happended is that I have been starting and stopping you while your code is bineg updated, memory architecture is being changed etc. can you make an appropriate note of that and write it to your memory?"

Clearing that unless something actually surfaces.\n\n**Current status check:**\n- Austin travel (Jan 20) - 11 days out, needs booking\n- Patent work conflict Sunday vs family time\n- Gaurav bottleneck still active risk\n- Monday: Eye apt + parents/grandma visit collision\n\nWhat's the actual priority pull right now?"

You just corrected me, but I don't have the context of what resolved it or when. \n\nThe conflicting entries suggest session breaks left me with both old and new status without proper transition.\n\n**What I need:** What actually happened with the Gaurav situation that moved it from bottleneck to resolved?\n\nThis is exactly the kind of gap that erodes trust - me carrying forward stale risk flags without knowing current reality."
