So Monday timeline:\n- Eye appointment: 3:00 PM in Provo (20-30 min drive)\n- Family visit: evening, also in Provo area\n\nThat's actually clean - one trip down, handle both.

Need to separate these.\n\nWhat's the family trip timeline? And is that you taking Bella and the family, or just family going without you?\n\nThis changes the booking priority completely."

And you're trying to launch Farmed/Stewspeed, file patents, AND keep work balance.\n\nThis is why the financial strategy matters - three cheer comps aren't cheap, plus your Austin business trip.\n\nWhat needs booking urgency besides Austin?

Can't just book Austin and wing the rest.\n\nWho's traveling for cheer comps? That multiplies hotel/flight costs fast."

This is unsustainable without serious pushback strategy.\n\nSunday with Monica maps the cheer logistics.

What's the ROI on each Austin-type business trip vs. opportunity cost of time away from higher-value activities?\n\nWithout those numbers, I can't help you make smart trade-offs. I can track complexity, but I can't guide you toward the exits that actually matter.\n\nWhen I naturally start framing decisions as \"this trip costs you 3 days that could generate $X in patent work vs. the $Y network value,\" then I'm thinking like the partner you need."
