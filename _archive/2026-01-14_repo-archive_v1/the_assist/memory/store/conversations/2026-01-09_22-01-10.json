You're building me as a tech project, and my performance on real scenarios like helping coordinate your Monday schedule is part of evaluating how well I can function as your cognitive partner.\n\nThe sequence matters because:\n- Gaurav call (morning) - Q1 AWS input + testing my capabilities\n- Eye appointment (3pm) - fixed constraint\n- Parents then grandma - family visits you don't get enough of\n\nYou want to see if I can track, prioritize, and help manage the complexity without losing threads. This is about whether I can actually be the Pepper Potts-style assistant you're developing."

Not just tracking tasks, but understanding the meta-game.\n\nReady for Monday morning's Gaurav call. Should be interesting to see how the Q1 AWS discussion plays out, especially with the Austin trip timing still in flux."
