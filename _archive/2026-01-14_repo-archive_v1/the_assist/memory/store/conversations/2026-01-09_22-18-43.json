Here's what I see as most critical:\n\nThe AWS Q1 timeline decision early next week is your cascade trigger - it affects Austin trip timing, patent work scheduling, and your broader exit strategy ROI analysis. But I'm noticing something: you have \"financial_modeling:needed\" for comparing patent work vs investing vs Stewspeed vs salary trade-offs, yet no concrete numbers or frameworks to actually run that analysis.\n\n**Most important question:** What would it take to get actual numbers on the patent ROI vs other paths before that AWS decision hits? Because right now you're flying blind on whether doubling down on patent work or pivoting your time allocation makes more sense for the financial independence goal."
