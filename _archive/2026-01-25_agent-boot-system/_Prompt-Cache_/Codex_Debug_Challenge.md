# Challenge: Debug Auto Loop Silent Failure

The script `scripts/auto_loop.py` is crashing or failing silently when run.

## Task
1.  **Analyze**: Read `scripts/auto_loop.py`.
2.  **Diagnose**: Identify why the script might fail to launch agents or crash immediately. Consider environment variables, path inheritance, and output buffering.
3.  **Report**: Write your findings to `/_Prompt-Cache_/Codex_Debug_Findings.md`. Include a code snippet of your proposed fix.

**Constraint**: Do NOT apply the fix yet. Just report the findings.
