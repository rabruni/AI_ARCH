# SPEC-DOPEJAR-001 — Overview

This spec pack defines the artifact-first rebuild/migration of the archived `the_assist` system into a new resident named Dopejar under this repo's Control Plane + Shaper workflow.

Primary intent artifacts live in:
- `artifacts/` (Shaper outputs, e.g., `SPEC.md`)
- `work_items/` (Shaper outputs, e.g., `WORK_ITEM.md`)
- `source_context/` (read-only archive-derived context snapshots)
