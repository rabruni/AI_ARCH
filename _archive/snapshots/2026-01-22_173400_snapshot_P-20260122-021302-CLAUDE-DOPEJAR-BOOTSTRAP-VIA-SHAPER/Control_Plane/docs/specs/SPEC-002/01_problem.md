# Problem Statement

## Current State

The Interface Contract runbook contains placeholder TODO markers instead of actionable governance content.

## Impact

- No documented contract for human-agent-control plane interactions
- No validation criteria for work item handoffs

## Root Cause

The runbook was scaffolded but never completed with concrete content.
