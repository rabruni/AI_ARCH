# SPEC-003: Work Item Execution Contract

**Status:** DRAFT
**Author:** Gemini
**Date:** 2026-01-16

## Overview

This specification introduces a new artifact, `WORK_ITEM.md`, to serve as a formal deterministic "execution contract" for AI worker agents. It acts as the canonical bridge between human-shaped intent and machine execution, ensuring that agent tasks are explicit, scoped, and verifiable.

This artifact, combined with a new validation script and an updated commit process, will significantly reduce agent ambiguity, prevent execution drift, and provide a clear, auditable record of work to be performed.
