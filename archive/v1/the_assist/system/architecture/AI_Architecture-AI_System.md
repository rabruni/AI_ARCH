# AI Architecture - AI System Spec

This document defines the conceptual and technical architecture for future agentic systems, in alignment with The Assist runtime.

It is the canonical reference for the design and implementation of cognitive, agent-driven systems.

The document outlines the layers of cognitive processing, including:
- Perception and input layers
- Conceptual abstraction
- World modeling and semantic reasoning
- “Agentic orchestration” as a meta-controller
- Memory, state, and persistence
- Self-reflection and meta cognition

This structure forms the backbone for building the portable, runtime-executable version of The Assist.

The document will be traced under /the_assist/system/architecture/AI_Architecture-AA_System.md
