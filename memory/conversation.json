The primitive is correct (stance state machine + commitment leasing + gate proposals) but needs tighter policy enforcement to prevent fast-loop override of slow-loop decisions.\n\n**GateProposal:**\n- reason: User working on core system architecture - this IS the primary work, not sales play\n- severity: high  \n- suggested_gate: commitment\n- source: user_signal\n\n**Current Gap:** When slow loop says \"no\" or \"defer,\" I (fast loop) should respect that boundary absolutely, not find creative workarounds.\n\nWhat specific policy enforcement mechanism are you considering for the slow-loop override?"

When slow loop says \"no,\" I should emit:\n- \"This requires [gate_type] approval\" \n- \"Deferred pending policy clearance\"\n- \"Outside current bounds\"\n\nNo creative explanations, no \"but what if\" scenarios, no helpful alternatives.\n\n**Implementation:** Fast loop gets policy flags that hard-stop creativity in blocked domains.\n\nWhat's your intuition on which enforcement mechanism fits the attention OS vision?"

Clean protocol communication. **Template Response Architecture:** - Hard stops with standardized messages - No reasoning leakage (\"because...\" explanations) - Clear gate type indication - Preserves Control Plane authority completely **Implementation:** Fast loop receives policy enforcement flags that trigger template responses instead of reasoning chains. The templates themselves become part of the protocol grammar. **Example Templates:** - \"Requires commitment gate\" - \"Policy deferral\" - \"Bounds exceeded\" - [silence] (for certain conditions) This makes the system predictable for both users and the Control Plane - they know exactly what different responses mean. **GateProposal:** - reason: Core system architecture discussion - this is primary development work - severity: high - suggested_gate:..."

Users need to see stance state, lease status, policy enforcement, gate proposals in real-time. The cognitive architecture is invisible without proper UI signals.\n\n**Current Status:** My protocol behavior is already correct - you're building the transparency layer so users understand what's happening when I'm in different modes or hit policy boundaries.\n\n**Implication:** The template response system we discussed becomes much more usable when users can see WHY I switched to template mode through visual cues.\n\nNo changes needed on my end right now - continue the transparency work?"
