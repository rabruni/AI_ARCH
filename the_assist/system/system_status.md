## Summary
The Assist is in a verified state, with full auto-chaining active. This means any future system boot or update will automatically create a new checkpoint, update the version log, and log the process to the preflight log.

This establishes The Assist as a fully auditable, self-governing system, with distributed memory, versioned integrity, and persistent provenance of every operational state.
